This unit explores different ways in which religious and non-religious people express their beliefs. It introduces pupils to key philosophical thinkers such as Plato and Descartes and encourages them to challenge what they think they already know. This will be done through a study of the three main aspects of philosophy: metaphysics, logic and moral philosophy. Metaphysics considers the nature of the world around us, logic investigates our process of reasoning (the way we think about ourselves and the world around us) and moral philosophy considers the nature of good and evil.",Times and dates in RE context.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Develop skills both written and verbal through individual work, group discussion and debate.
